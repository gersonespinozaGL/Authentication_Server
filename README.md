# Authentication Server

Dotnet version: 3.1.423 (netcore)
Compiling: dotnet build
Running (without docker): dotnet run


## Testing

When running the application ypu can interact with the controllers by:

- Swagger UI: UI generated to test the controllers and individual requests. This is the access for it: https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html. Currently the browser sometimes doesn't trust the application and closes the connection, to fix this you can allow all permissions for that link (workaround). This will be fixed soon.
